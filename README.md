Jira is a project management tool. It is widely used for tracking and managing software development projects, as well as other types of projects. Jira provides features for issue tracking, bug tracking, task management, and agile project management, including support for Scrum and Kanban methodologies. It allows teams to plan, track, and release software, manage project workflows, and collaborate effectively. Here, I have used Kanban methodology for ecommerce application project.
